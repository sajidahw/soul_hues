# Soul Hues, a custom ChatGPT AI Chatbot

Soul Hues is a personality color discovery app which can turn a user’s colors into artwork.
This app uses a personalized and interactive AI chatbot (OpenAI's ChatGPT-4) creation to determine a
person’s color based on their personality and then uses DALL-E to create a watercolor
painting with their approved colors.

This will be a MERN stack app where users will be able to authenticate their credentials using middleware validation chains (express-validator), JWT tokens (JSON web tokens), HTTP-Only cookies (cookie parser), signed cookies and password encryption using bcrypt.

Users will be able to store their AI chatbot sessions within a MongoDB database for 7 days (retrieval and deletion) and interact with the AI in a React based front-end interface using mostly JavaScript.
